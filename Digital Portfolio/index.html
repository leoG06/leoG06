	About me
      </h1>

      My name is Leonardo Goncalves and for as long as I can remeber, I knew I wanted to grow up and work with computer.
      I was born in Brazil and there I had many different interactions with possibles different fields of work, but I
      would always gravitate towards any computer related field. I'm 15 years old and am currently studying in Allen high
      school and taking a computer science class.
