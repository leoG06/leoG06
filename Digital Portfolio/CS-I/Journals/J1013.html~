  1.1 Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction equal sign with three lines and a ?

  Because for the output to be true, you would need to have the two inputs not equal eachother.


  2.1 Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2 to the n?

  The formula is only determined in the number of inputs beacuse it is the inputs that determine the outputs. Because the number of outputs gets increasingly larger.

  What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
  The big idea is that Boolean algebra is highly important for computer science.
  
  What challenges did I encounter?
  I had no chalenges
          
  How could this experience be improved?
  This experience could be improved if there was more explanation of the x imples y.


  Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
  What I learned changes my thinking by making me more sure that I want to work in the computer science industry when I grow up.
