	1.1 Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.

	You add the individual numbers together from right to left and if the number goes over the base number, you subtract the number by the base number and 1 to the following “line”


	2.1 What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?

	The numbers only go up to 8, not like the one we are used to.


	3.1 What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?

	We need to convert the numbers over 10 into a base number of 10 before adding so it is easier for us to add.


	4.1 What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?

	We need to make pay attention to what part of the addition we are at because it is very easy to get lost while calculating them.

  What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
 Number bases additions are very important because we can use our calculatye in binary with them
  
  What challenges did I encounter?
  I had no chalenges
          
  How could this experience be improved?
  This experience could be improved if there were more questions.


  Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
  What I learned changes my thinking by making me more sure that I want to work in the computer science industry when I grow up.
